## About the Project

This project addresses the need for an automated and accurate method to classify apples based on their color. By utilizing computer vision models trained on image data, it enables precise color classification, ensuring uniformity in quality grading. This solution is particularly beneficial for farmers, distributors, and food processing companies, as it enhances the efficiency of sorting processes, improves product consistency, and reduces reliance on manual labor. Additionally, it supports better inventory management and market pricing strategies by providing detailed insights into apple quality and distribution.

### Example:
This project is designed to solve the problem of inconsistent and labor-intensive color classification of apples by employing computer vision algorithms to automate and optimize the process. It is particularly useful for farmers, distributors, and food processing companies because it ensures uniform quality, increases operational efficiency, and reduces manual errors, ultimately enhancing the overall value chain in the apple production and distribution industry.
